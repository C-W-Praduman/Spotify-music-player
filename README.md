# 🎵 Custom Music Player (Spotify-Inspired)

I created this project from scratch to test myself and apply everything I've learned about frontend development so far. Instead of following a tutorial or copying an existing challenge, I built this music player UI and logic on my own to simulate a real-world frontend project.

## 🧐 Overview

### ✅ The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View a Spotify-like music player UI.
- Click on music cards to load and play songs.
- Use a bottom-fixed player bar to control playback.
- Play, pause, skip forward or back.
- Drag a progress bar and see timestamps update.
- Adjust volume using a green-filled slider.
- Get visual feedback (like icon toggles, progress fill, and error handling).

## 🛠️ My Process

### 🔧 Built With

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS3** (Flexbox + Custom Scrollbars + CSS Variables)
- **JavaScript** (Vanilla)
- **Mobile-first** workflow

### 📚 What I Learned

This project helped me:
- Understand the logic behind audio playback and player controls.
- Work with DOM events to build an interactive music experience.
- Use CSS for custom sliders (volume and timeline) with dynamic color fill.
- Handle edge cases like playing the first song by default or avoiding NaN durations.
- Practice the frontend mindset of thinking through UX and polishing every detail.

### 🔁 Continued Development

In future updates, I plan to:

- Add a dark/light theme toggle.
- Add repeat, shuffle, and custom queue support.
- Possibly rebuild this with **React.js** and **Firebase** as a full-stack music app.
